Testing:
The testing for all 3 classes are hard coded in the main function of each of the class file.
Testing for Patient, Ward, Surgeon, Doctor class can be done by running the main function of each class.
Testing for Patient and Doctor requires BasicDoctor and person class. Testing for Surgeon class requires DOctor class. Since these classes inherit from the super classes.
No test drivers were provided, so each main function needs to be called seperately.
If errors were found, a print statement will show in which method are errors.

Assignment status:

Every methods in each class works as intended, and the HospitalSystem functions well. However the system is not very robust. If more time is given, then every single method that
has an argument would have assert statements to check if the arguments are valid. This will make the program much more robust, but
this will also take a massive amount of time to complete.
