Testing:

The testing for all 3 classes are hard coded in the main function of each of the class file.
Testing for Person, Ward and BasicDoctor class can be done by running the main function of each class.
Testing for Ward class must be done while the Person class is present, since the Ward class has a Person array list.
A test driver called Assignment2Tester.java is provided to run all 3 main functions.
If errors were found, a print statement will show in which method are errors.

Assignment status

The 3 classes made for this assignment are currently working properly. All getter, setters, constructors, and methods are tested in
the main method to make sure the classes work alone and with each other. That being said,
a few minor adjustments can be made to make the code more efficient: the constructor for Ward can take an argument
called numberofBeds that can be used to automatically create a Person list array in the object, instead of manually passing
in an empty Person array list when creating the object.
